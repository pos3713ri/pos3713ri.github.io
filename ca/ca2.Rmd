### Due Monday, April 8, at 3pm.

# Do the following:

Start a new project in RStudio Cloud. 

Install the package tidyverse.

Upload the `.rds` version of the `health` data set from the [data page](../data.html). This data set contains measures of approval for the ACA and measure of health at the state level from about 2013.

Start a new R script. Save the script as `analysis.R`.

In the script, do the following (include comments!):

   a. Load the tidyverse package.
   a. Load the data file `health.rds`.
   a. Use the glimpse functions to quickly (1) check the data are what you expect and (2) see the variable names. Compare to the [codebook](data/health-codebook.html) if you need more information.
   a. **Create a scatterplot** with the following features:
       1. the level of uninsurance (`percent_uninsured`) along the x-axis.
       1. the percent favorable to the ACA (`percent_favorable_aca`) along the y-axis.
       1. rather than use `geom_point()` use `geom_label()` where the states' two-letter code (`state_abbr`) corresponds to the `label` aesthetic. 
       1. the regression line through the data.
       1. the life expectancy in the state (`life_expectancy`) corresponds to the `color` aesthetic.
       1. a nice title, subtitle, axis labels, etc.
   a. At the bottom of your script, in a single comment, **explain the scatterplot**. 
       1. Explain the pattern you observe. 
       1. Note whether there's anything unexpected. 
       1. Speculate about why we obtain that particular pattern.

Once you are satisfied with your code and observations, click the tiny notebook icon (to the left of the *Run* button). When prompted, select *PDF* (PDF tends to work better, in my experience) or *MS Word*. You may be prompted to download the document--do it! If not, then select the *Files* tab in the lower-right, check the box for the document you want to download (it should be `analysis.docx` or `analysis.pdf`), and click *More > Export...*, and follow the instructions Submit this `docx` or `.pdf` file to Canvas. Do not submit the `.R` script itself.

Examples: 

The follow shows the basic format of the R code and shows what the output should look like after you compile it into a notebook.

- R script [[R](../ca/example.R)]
- MS Word Output [[docx](../ca/example.docx)]
- PDF Output [[pdf](../ca/example.pdf)]
