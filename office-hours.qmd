title: "Office Hours"
---

I'm almost always free to chat for a few minutes after class, either in our classroom or in my office.

My office hours are Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. If you want to come to my official office hours, please [let me know you are coming](https://calendly.com/carlislerainey/30-minute-meeting).^[I have conflicts (e.g., a meeting) a meaningful fraction of the time; Calendly let me communicate when my office hours are canceled.]

If after class or office hours are inconvenient for you, I'm happy to arrange anther time. [Email me](mailto:crainey@fsu.edu) at `crainey@fsu.edu` to set it up.
