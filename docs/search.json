    "text": "Overview\nWe‚Äôll borrow Gerring‚Äôs (2012, 722)1 definition of a descriptive argument:\n1¬†See also Part II of Gerring‚Äôs Social Science Methodology for a supplement to Gerrying (2012).\nA descriptive argument describes some aspect of the world. In doing so, it aims to answer what questions (e.g., when, whom, out of what, in what manner) about a phenomenon or a set of phenomena. Descriptive arguments are about what is/was. For example: ‚ÄòOver the course of the past two centuries there have been three major waves of democratization.‚Äô\n\nYou might feel confused. After all, Gerring writes that description ‚Äúhas come to be employed as a euphemism for a failed, or not yet proven, causal inference.‚Äù At best, we might think that description only serves to support the primary task of causal inference. Indeed, King, Keohane, and Verba (1994, 34) write that ‚Äúdescription, in turn, loses most of its interest unless linked to some causal relationships.‚Äù\nHowever, description is an essential component of social science. de Kadt and Grzymala-Busse (2025) argue that description is ‚Äúa fundamental component of the social scientific enterprise‚Äù (2) that ‚Äúengages theory by invoking existing theories, motivating new theoretical models and their refinement, and in some cases even evaluating theory‚Äù (24). Gerring writes that ‚Äúdescription can be written out of the discipline only at great cost to our understandings of the world‚Äù (744). And Holmes et al. (2024) write that ‚Äúanswering questions of ‚Äòwho,‚Äô ‚Äòwhat,‚Äô ‚Äòwhen,‚Äô ‚Äòwhere,‚Äô and ‚Äòhow‚Äô‚Äîin concert with but also independent from causal inquiry‚Äîis vital to the continued relevance and coherence of our discipline in both scholarly and public-facing work‚Äù (54).\nAs a whole, I suggest that social science asks: how can we intervene to make the world a better place? This implies three parts.\n\nFirst, what does the world look like now?\nSecond, what worlds would be better?\nAnd third, what are the effects of potential interventions?\n\nI view answers the the first question‚Äîa description of the world as it exists‚Äîas a difficult and worthwhile challenge. It seems difficult to even entertain the second and third questions without a thorough understanding of the world as it exists.\nAnd you may think that description is easy, and establishing causality is hard. I think you‚Äôll find that description is easier statistically, but a more difficult struggle overall.2\n2¬†My thinking is something like this. When you randomly assign \\(T\\) and you measure \\(Y\\) afterward, you‚Äôve established that \\(T\\) causes \\(X\\). But suppose that you just measure \\(Y\\). It isn‚Äôt clear what you‚Äôve just measured or whether it‚Äôs meaningful. Of course, these same questions lay hiding in the shadows in the randomized experiment. But the randomization guarantees a ‚Äúcausal inference‚Äù that is sufficient to strike our fancy. The descriptive argument brings the subtler questions of measures and their meanings into the broad daylight. Fuzzy concepts and measurements can‚Äôt hide behind a ‚Äúcompelling identification strategy‚Äù when you are making a descriptive argument.Examples of the struggle to describe are easy to find. Consider two ideas that are central to political science: ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù or ‚Äúpolitical ideology.‚Äù If a reporter from the New York Times asked whether democracy was in decline around the world, the answer isn‚Äôt easy or obvious. Political scientists are not in agreement. If that reporter asked you whether there are many or few moderate voters in the US, the answer isn‚Äôt obvious or easy. Again, political scientists are not in agreement."

    "text": "A Recent Debate About Moderates\nA recent exchange in the American Political Science Review centers on how best to characterize ideological moderation in the American public. In the original article, Fowler et al. (2023) develop a statistical model to distinguish among types of moderates, finding that while a single ideological dimension captures most Americans‚Äô policy views, moderates‚Äîespecially those not neatly aligned‚Äîremain central to electoral accountability. In response, Broockman and Lauderdale (2025) critique this approach, arguing that it overestimates the number of genuinely one-dimensional voters and fails to account for individuals with cross-pressured or multidimensional views. Finally, Fowler et al. (2024) reply by showing that Broockman and Lauderdale‚Äôs visual and simulation-based critiques do not invalidate their main conclusions, reaffirming that most Americans‚Äô policy preferences are well summarized by a single ideological dimension and that most such individuals are ideologically moderate."

    "text": "Normative Questions\nNormative questions ask: ‚ÄúWhat should the world look like?‚Äù\nIn my experience, most people associate political science with normative questions. When I tell people that I‚Äôm a political scientist, they tend to ask me normative questions.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think we should invade Iran, do you?‚Äù (Asking for a moral judgement about foreign policy.)\n‚ÄúWhat do you think about the breakdown of the family in the U.S?‚Äù (Implicitly asking for a moral judgement about social policy, i.e., ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt the government adopt more pro-family policies?‚Äù)\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think we‚Äôre rewarding laziness?‚Äù (Implicitly asking for a moral judgement about economic policy, i.e., ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be doing that, should we?‚Äù.)\n\nThese are normative questions, if perhaps somewhat ill-formed. They are important questions. Some political scientists, called ‚Äúpolitical philosophers‚Äù or ‚Äúnormative political theorists,‚Äù focus on these types of questions.\nSome important questions asked by normative political theorists include:\n\nShould the state redistribute wealth?\nUnder what conditions is war justified?\nWhat types of behavior should the state regulate?\nHow should states make policy?\n\nWe will not focus on these types of questions.\nHowever, we all bring normative views with us, and these views are helpful. Normative views can motivate us to focus on certain descriptive and causal questions. For example, perhaps you believe that democracy is the most normatively desirable form of government. This might lead you to describe how well democracy works in the U.S. (descriptive) or explain why some countries remain authoritarian (causal). Perhaps you believe that governments should not torture. This might lead you to describe the extent to which certain states use torture (descriptive) or the types of institutional arrangements (independent courts?) that reduce torture (causal).\nReversing the cycle, answers to descriptive and causal questions might inform our normative views. For example, if you know that income equality reduces economic growth, then perhaps you think the U.S. should adopt a more redistributive economic policy.\nNormative questions can motivate descriptive and causal questions. Descriptive and causal questions can inform normative debates. But it is important to draw a sharp distinction between normative questions and descriptive/causal questions, because the two require completely different approaches.\nFor this class, we‚Äôll not focus at all on normative questions. Instead, we‚Äôll focus on descriptive and causal questions."

    "text": "Causal Questions\nCausal questions ask: ‚ÄúWhy does the work look the way it does?‚Äù\nCausal questions ask about a cause or an effect. They ask for an explanation‚Äìwhy did something happen? We might be interested in the following causal questions:\n\nWhy is income inequality so high in the U.S.? Why is it growing so fast at the moment?\nWhat causes war between two countries?\nWhy do some states become democratic while others remain authoritarian?\nWhat is the effect of an independent court of last resort?\nWhat explains low turnout in the U.S.?\nWhy do some countries have many political parties and other countries have few?\nWhy does policy change rapidly in some times and/or places, but slowly in others?\nDoes presidentialism cause democratic failure?\n\nCausal questions and claims are about action. We have one variable acting on another. There are lots of verbs that summarize action: causes, influences, affects, changes, increases, decreases, etc. Causal questions ask us to use these sorts of verbs to describe the way the world works.\n\nMeaning\nWe use the word ‚Äúcause‚Äù quite a bit in everyday language. We might say, for example, that smoking causes cancer. In making causal claims about politics, we might say things like ‚Äúwealth causes democracy‚Äù or ‚Äúeducation causes turnout.‚Äù\nBut what do these causal claims really mean? What does it mean for something to cause something else?\nThe idea of causation relies on the counterfactual. The counterfactual requires us to imagine a world that does not exist (i.e., runs counter to fact).\nFor example, suppose Amy has a college degree and voted in 2012. But we want to know if the college degree caused Amy to vote. In order to answer that question, we simply need to consider the counterfactual world in which Amy did not receive a college degree.\nWe might imagine rewinding time and simply removing Amy‚Äôs opportunity to attend college (but nothing else), then letting time move forward to 2012 and observing whether Amy votes. If Amy does not vote in the counterfactual world, then we say that the college degree caused Amy to vote. If Amy does vote in the counterfactual world, then we say that the college degree did not cause Amy to vote.\n\nIn order to assess causation, we simply need to imagine what would happen in the counterfactual world where the potential cause did or did not happen. We must compare two scenarios: the world in which the treatment happened to the world in which the treatment did not happen.\n\n\n\nProblem\nIt turns out that these questions are quite difficult to answer. We refer to the problem as ‚Äúthe fundamental problem of causal inference.‚Äù\nThe difficulty lies in the fact that we cannot observe the counterfactual world. In our example, we cannot observe whether Amy would have voted if she did not receive a college degree.\n\nBecause we cannot observe the counterfactual, we cannot observe causation. This is general‚Äîbecause causation is defined in terms of something unobservable, we cannot observe causation. This also points to the crucial distinction between descriptive and causal claims. We can observe whether or not descriptive claims are true. We cannot observe whether causal claims are true without a little bit of trickery.\nThere are some tricks to get around this problem, but it changes the question somewhat. For example, if the researcher randomly assigns subjects to a treatment or control group, she can discuss the ‚Äúaverage causal effect.‚Äù We‚Äôll discuss this in detail later, but be aware that we‚Äôll fight with this problem all semester."

Importantly, functions are followed immediately by parentheses (i.e., (), not [] or {}, which have different meanings). Arguments are supplied in the functions that tell the function what to do. We separate multiple arguments with commas.\nYou probably didn‚Äôt think about it at the time, but you can use many different bases when taking a logarithm. What base did we use when we ran log(b)? To see this, let‚Äôs open the help file.\n\nhelp(log) # or, equivalently, ?log\n\n\nThe section ‚ÄúUsage‚Äù shows the typical function syntax. The log() function takes up to two arguments. The first argument x is a ‚Äúnumeric vector.‚Äù We‚Äôll talk more specifically about numeric vectors below, but for now, we can consider a scalar as a numeric vector. If we provide the arguments in the same order that they appear in the function in the ‚ÄúUsage‚Äù section, then we do not have to name the argument, but we still can. For example, log(b) and log(x = b) are equivalent.\n\nProTip: If you need to know how to use a particular function such as exp(), type help(exp) or ?exp into the console.\n\nYou‚Äôll also see from the help file that the default is base = exp(1), where exp(1) is just the number \\(e\\), the base of the natural log.

However, the meaning of log(b, base = 10) is clearer, so I prefer that approach.\n\nProTip: If arguments are supplied to functions in the correct order, then names are unnecessary. However, names should be included whenever there might be doubt about the meaning of the argument. In practice, this most often means leaving the first argument unnamed and naming the rest.\n\nReview Exercises\n\nOpen a new script and give the object x the scalar 32.\nRepeat the first set of review exercises using x rather than the number 2.\nAdd comments explaining what the code is doing."

Maybe they are a respondent‚Äôs sex (i.e., \"Male\" or \"Female\") or party identification (i.e., \"Republican\", \"Democrat\", \"Independent\", or \"Other\").\nWe‚Äôll call this collection of numbers or character strings a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and we‚Äôll refer to the number of elements in the vector as the ‚Äúlength‚Äù of the vector.\nThere are several types of vectors, classified by the sort of elements they contain.\n\nnumeric: contain numbers, such as 1.1, 2.4, and 3.4. Sometimes numeric variables are subdivided into integer (whole numbers, e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) and double (fractions, e.g., 1.47, 3.35462, etc.).\ncharacter: contain character strings, such as \"Republican\" or \"Argentina (2001)\".\nfactor: contain character strings, such as \"Very Liberal\", \"Weak Republican\", or \"Female\". Similar to character, except the entire set of possible levels (and their ordering) is defined.\nlogical: contain TRUE and/or FALSE.\n\n\nNumeric Vectors\nRather than the scalar 2, for example, we might want to work with the collection 2, 5, 9, 7, and 3. Let‚Äôs assign the collection above to the object a.\nWe can create a vector using the ‚Äúcollect‚Äù function c().\n\na &lt;- c(2, 5, 9, 7, 3)\n\n\nProTip: To create a vector, one tool we can use is the ‚Äúcollect‚Äù function c().\n\nIf we want to look at the object a, we need to enter a on a line by itself. This will print the object a for us to inspect. But since we only need to check this once, maybe we just type it in the console instead of including it in the script.\n\na\n\n[1] 2 5 9 7 3\n\n\nWe can now apply functions to the vector a just like we did for the scalar b. In some cases, the function operates on each element of the vector (e.g., log()); in other cases, the function combines the elements into a new number (e.g., mean()).\n\na + 3\n\n[1]  5  8 12 10  6\n\na*3\n\n[1]  6 15 27 21  9\n\na^3\n\n[1]   8 125 729 343  27\n\n3^a\n\n[1]     9   243 19683  2187    27\n\na/3\n\n[1] 0.6666667 1.6666667 3.0000000 2.3333333 1.0000000\n\nexp(a)\n\n[1]    7.389056  148.413159 8103.083928 1096.633158   20.085537\n\nlog(a)\n\n[1] 0.6931472 1.6094379 2.1972246 1.9459101 1.0986123\n\nlog(a, base = 10)\n\n[1] 0.3010300 0.6989700 0.9542425 0.8450980 0.4771213\n\nsqrt(a)\n\n[1] 1.414214 2.236068 3.000000 2.645751 1.732051\n\n# sum() adds all the elements together\nsum(a)\n\n[1] 26\n\n# mean() finds the average‚Äînow we're doing statistics!\nmean(a)\n\n[1] 5.2\n\n\nSo far, we‚Äôve only used numeric vectors‚Äîvectors that contain numbers. But we can create and work with other types of vectors as well. For now, let‚Äôs just illustrate two types: vectors of character strings, factors (and ordered factors), and logical vectors.\nReview Exercises\n\nIn a script (perhaps the script you began in the exercises above), create a numeric vector assigning the collection 2, 6, 4, 3, 5, and 17 to the object my_vector.\nCreate another numeric vector assigning the collection 64, 13, and 67 to the object myOtherVector.\nUse the sum() function to add the elements of my_vector together.\nUse the sqrt() function to take the square root of the elements of myOtherVector.\nAdd 3 to the elements of my_vector.\nAdd comments to the script explaining what this code is doing.\n\n\n\nCharacter Vectors\nCharacter strings are simply letters (or numbers, I suppose) surrounded by quotes, such as \"Republican\" or \"Male\". If we c() (i.e., ‚Äúcombine‚Äù) together multiple character strings, then we have a character vector.\n\n# create character vector\nx &lt;- c(\"Republican\", \"Democrat\", \"Republican\", \"Independent\")\n\n# print x\nx\n\n[1] \"Republican\"  \"Democrat\"    \"Republican\"  \"Independent\"\n\n# for fun, try to multiply x times 3\nx*3  # doesn't work\n\nError in x * 3: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nReview Exercises\n\nCreate a character vector containing the elements Male, Female, Male, Male, and Female. Assign this vector to the object sex.\nCreate a character vector containing the elements Liberal, Moderate, Moderate, Conservative, and Liberal. Assign this vector to the object ideology.\n\n\n\nFactor Vectors\nA factor vector is much like a character vector, but can only take on predefined values. While we might use a character vector to encode a variable that can have a variety of values (e.g., respondent‚Äôs name), we might use a factor to encode a variable that can take on just a few values, such as party identification (e.g., ‚ÄúRepublican,‚Äù ‚ÄúIndependent,‚Äù ‚ÄúDemocrat,‚Äù ‚ÄúOther‚Äù). We refer to the possible values of a factor as the ‚Äúlevels.‚Äù\nCreating a factor is trickier than creating a numeric or character vector. We might take several approaches, but I suggest the following two-step approach:\n\nCreate a character vector containing the information using c().\nAdd the levels using the factor() function. We define the possible levels and their order by supplying a character vector to the levels argument.\n\nFactor vectors have two particular advantages over character vectors.\n\nThey allow us to easily see when one category has zero observations.\nThey allow us to control the order in which the categories appear. This will be useful, even for categorical variables that have no natural ordering (e.g., race, eye color).\n\n\n# create a character vector\npid &lt;- c(\"Republican\", \"Republican\", \"Democrat\", \"Other\")\n\n# check type\nclass(pid)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# table pid\ntable(pid) # two problems: 1-weird order; 2-\"Independent\" missing\n\npid\n  Democrat      Other Republican \n         1          1          2 \n\n\nWe can fix these two problems by using a factor vector instead.\n\n# create a factor vector in two steps\n## step 1: create a character vector\npid_ch &lt;- c(\"Republican\", \"Republican\", \"Democrat\", \"Other\")\n## step 2: add levels using factor()\npid_fct &lt;- factor(\n  pid_ch,\n  levels = c(\"Republican\", \"Independent\", \"Democrat\", \"Other\")\n)\n\n# check type\nclass(pid_ch)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(pid_fct)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n# tables\ntable(pid_ch)\n\npid_ch\n  Democrat      Other Republican \n         1          1          2 \n\ntable(pid_fct)\n\npid_fct\n Republican Independent    Democrat       Other \n          2           0           1           1 \n\n\nYou can see that by creating a factor variable that contains the level information, we can see that we have no Independents in our sample of four respondents. We can also control the ordering of the categories.\nReview Exercises\n\nChange the character vector sex created above to a factor vector. Be sure to explicitly add the levels. The order does not matter. Assign this new factor variable to the object sex_factor.\nChange the character vector ideology created above to a factor vector. Be sure to explicitly add the levels. Use an intuitive ordering. Assign this new factor variable to the object ideology_factor.\n\n\n\nLogical Vectors\nLogical vectors contain elements that are true or false. R has a special way to represent true and false elements. R uses TRUE (without quotes) to represent true elements and FALSE (again, without quotes) to represent false elements. To create a logical vector, we can c() together a series of TRUEs and/or FALSEs.\n\n# create logical vector\nx &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\n# print x\nx  # or you could use print(x)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nReview Exercises\n\nCreate the logical vector containing TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, and TRUE. Assign it to the object logic1.\nMultiply logic1 times 3. What do you get? Does that make sense?"

Many students are too afraid of being wrong. ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù frees us up to use our imagination.\n\n\nConcepts are simply mental constructs. For our purposes, concepts are words that we use to describe political entities. For example, we can use the concept of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and describe the United States as a democracy. We can use the concept of ‚Äúliberal‚Äù and refer to Nancy Pelosi as a liberal.\nConcepts are important because they allow us to communicate and reason precisely and accurately about political events. In general, ambiguous concepts need work. We need precise, well-defined concepts. They will never be perfect, but we should always push ourselves toward more precision and clarity.\nSome concepts are easier to define precisely than others, for example. ‚ÄúVote share‚Äù is easy to define. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúideology‚Äù are not so easy.\nTo illustrate, answer the following question: What is a democracy? This is harder than it seems.\nConcepts in political science tend to be more abstract and ill-defined. But it is essential to define our concepts as precisely as possible. Before we can answer questions about our concepts, we must know what our concepts mean!\nDoes negativity cause an increase or a decrease in turnout? To answer this, we certainly need to know if ‚ÄúThe incumbent voted for Obamacare‚Äù is considered negativity.\n\n\n\nA model is simply a tentative explanation of observed phenomena, used to better understand the world. Models need not be accurate in every respect. A model is sometimes referred to as a theory, explanation, or story.\nModels connect concepts in a causal fashion. One minimal model, for example, is that increasing the level of democracy in a country leads to more economic growth. In this case, we have two concepts, democracy and economic growth, connected causally. Of course, we‚Äôd want to elaborate a bit and flesh this model out into a fuller explanation. Why is it, exactly, that democracy causes growth?\nWe can also think of models as logical defenses or justifications of causal claims. For example, we might take two or three basic principles or axioms as given, and deduce causal claims from this. For example, we might assume that people behave in a way that benefits them most financially. We might also assume that the Republicans tend to adopt lower tax rates than Democrats. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that an increase in one‚Äôs wealth makes them more likely to vote Republican.\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôll spend some time later in the semester talking about measurements and comparisons. But for now, simply note that measurements are simply quantifications of our concepts. In order to study a phenomenon systematically, we often want to assign numbers to the entities of interest. If we are interested in the concept of economic growth, for example, then the percent change in GDP is a good way to quantify that concept. Similarly, if we are interested in democracy, then we might develop a process for assigning each country a score from -10 to 10, where -10 represents the least democratic countries and 10 represents the most democratic countries.\nOnce we have these measures, we‚Äôll want to make the appropriate comparisons. For example, we might want to compare the average economic growth in democracies and non-democracies."

Assumptions are usually simplifications (e.g., politicians are office-seeking). Many good models are based on simple, but incorrect assumptions.\n\nAssumptions sometimes cannot be observed directly.\nTesting assumptions distracts your attention from the implications of the model. Get it the habit of exploring and evaluating the range of implications of the model.\nThat said, all else equal, we would prefer a model based on correct assumptions.\n\n\nIn particular, the model should allow us to make predictions (note that we can have a predictive model, that is not necessarily causal. However, causal models should be predictive of future observations.)\n\nQuestion: How could we evaluate the truth of our model of ACA opinions?\n\nBeware of circular or tautological models (e.g., people do what is in their self interest)\nFind critical experiments. The ideal approach is to compare alternative models. When we have two competing models, we‚Äôd like to find a situation in which the two model produce different implications. This is a powerful situation, because only one of the models can be correct.\nTo the extent possible, always think in terms of alternative models, as opposed to a single model being right or wrong.\n\nBeauty (e.g., Downs)\n\nSimplicity (office-seeking) - some assert that simpler models are more likely to be correct.\nFertility (produces many implications)\nSurprise (why is turnout so high?)\n\nJustice - does the model advance normative goals?"
