Many students are too afraid of being wrong. “speculation” frees us up to use our imagination.\n\n\nConcepts are simply mental constructs. For our purposes, concepts are words that we use to describe political entities. For example, we can use the concept of “democracy” and describe the United States as a democracy.

To answer this, we certainly need to know if “The incumbent voted for Obamacare” is considered negativity.\n\n\n\nA model is simply a tentative explanation of observed phenomena, used to better understand the world. Models need not be accurate in every respect. A model is sometimes referred to as a theory, explanation, or story.\nModels connect concepts in a causal fashion. One minimal model, for example, is that increasing the level of democracy in a country leads to more economic growth. In this case, we have two concepts, democracy and economic growth, connected causally. Of course, we’d want to elaborate a bit and flesh this model out into a fuller explanation. Why is it, exactly, that democracy causes growth?\nWe can also think of models as logical defenses or justifications of causal claims. For example, we might take two or three basic principles or axioms as given, and deduce causal claims from this. For example, we might assume that people behave in a way that benefits them most financially. We might also assume that the Republicans tend to adopt lower tax rates than Democrats. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that an increase in one’s wealth makes them more likely to vote Republican.\n\n\n\nWe’ll spend some time later in the semester talking about measurements and comparisons. But for now, simply note that measurements are simply quantifications of our concepts. In order to study a phenomenon systematically, we often want to assign numbers to the entities of interest. If we are interested in the concept of economic growth, for example, then the percent change in GDP is a good way to quantify that concept. Similarly, if we are interested in democracy, then we might develop a process for assigning each country a score from -10 to 10, where -10 represents the least democratic countries and 10 represents the most democratic countries.\nOnce we have these measures, we’ll want to make the appropriate comparisons. For example, we might want to compare the average economic growth in democracies and non-democracies."

    "text": "Building Models\nBut how do you build a model? How do you put together a compelling logical defense of a causal claim?\nA model of the model-building process:\n\nStep 1: Observe some facts. If these facts are puzzling, even better. (e.g., a large percentage of people vote, countries fight wars—notice that our models are what make these facts puzzling)\nStep 2: Look at the facts as though they were the end result of some unknown process (model). Then speculate about the process that might have produced such a result. We’re thinking in terms of causation here\nStep 3: Deduce other results (implications, hypotheses, or predictions) from the model.\nStep 4: Then ask yourself whether these other implications are true and produce new models if necessary.\n\nSome rules of thumb for model-building:\n\nRule 1: Think “process.” In particular, think about causality. One thing leads to another, which causes two changes, which both affect the concept we care about.\nRule 2: Develop interesting implications. An interesting implication might be one that would otherwise (i.e., in the absence of the model) be counterintuitive. It might also be an implication for which we have the appropriate data.\nRule 3: Look for generality. If you start with a theory about US voter behavior, can you generalize it to voting behavior in other places? Finding generalizations usually involves generalizing nouns.\nRule 4: Realize that model-building is a slow process\nRule 5: Talk about your ideas."

    "text": "Evaluating Models\nTruth\n\nAre the implications of the model correct?\n\nWhat about the assumptions? In practice, we don’t worry much about the assumptions for a few reasons. Assumptions are usually simplifications (e.g., politicians are office-seeking). Many good models are based on simple, but incorrect assumptions.\n\nAssumptions sometimes cannot be observed directly.\nTesting assumptions distracts your attention from the implications of the model. Get it the habit of exploring and evaluating the range of implications of the model.\nThat said, all else equal, we would prefer a model based on correct assumptions.\n\n\nIn particular, the model should allow us to make predictions (note that we can have a predictive model, that is not necessarily causal. However, causal models should be predictive of future observations.)\n\nQuestion: How could we evaluate the truth of our model of ACA opinions?\n\nBeware of circular or tautological models (e.g., people do what is in their self interest)\nFind critical experiments. The ideal approach is to compare alternative models. When we have two competing models, we’d like to find a situation in which the two model produce different implications. This is a powerful situation, because only one of the models can be correct.\nTo the extent possible, always think in terms of alternative models, as opposed to a single model being right or wrong.\n\nBeauty (e.g., Downs)\n\nSimplicity (office-seeking) - some assert that simpler models are more likely to be correct.\nFertility (produces many implications)\nSurprise (why is turnout so high?)\n\nJustice - does the model advance normative goals?"

On average, turnout is about 48% in the U.S., 83% in Brazil, 87% in Denmark, and 93% in Chile. Many researchers believe that low turnout is a problem for a democracy and would like to see higher turnout in the US.\n\nMake up two theories or models that explain the variation in turnout across countries.\nFind some critical fact/situation/observation/prediction that distinguishes between the two models.

They have curiosity. ‘Who, what, where, why, when, and how!’ They never stop asking questions, and I never stop asking questions, just like a five year old.” —Sylvia Earle, marine biologist\nSee also a relevant xkcd comic.\nIn political science, we ask a lot of questions about politics, such as these questions about marriage equality:\nOr these questions about income inequality:\nIn answering these questions, we might make claims about politics. Claims are just answers to questions. We might make the following claims about marriage equality:\nOr we might make these claims about income inequality:\nPolitical science is all about asking and answering questions. But the best approach to answering a question depends on the type of question.\nI break the questions we might ask (or claims we might make) about politics into three types: normative, descriptive, and causal. Answering each type question requires a different approach."

    "section": "Normative Questions",
    "text": "Normative Questions\nNormative questions ask: “What should the world look like?”\nIn my experience, most people associate political science with normative questions. When I tell people that I’m a political scientist, they tend to ask me normative questions.\n\n“You don’t think we should invade Iran, do you?” (Asking for a moral judgement about foreign policy.)\n“What do you think about the breakdown of the family in the U.S?” (Implicitly asking for a moral judgement about social policy, i.e., “Shouldn’t the government adopt more pro-family policies?”)\n“Don’t you think we’re rewarding laziness?” (Implicitly asking for a moral judgement about economic policy, i.e., “We shouldn’t be doing that, should we?”.)\n\nThese are normative questions, if perhaps somewhat ill-formed. They are important questions. Some political scientists, called “political philosophers” or “normative political theorists,” focus on these types of questions.\nSome important questions asked by normative political theorists include:\n\nShould the state redistribute wealth?\nUnder what conditions is war justified?\nWhat types of behavior should the state regulate?\nHow should states make policy?\n\nWe will not focus on these types of questions.\nHowever, we all bring normative views with us, and these views are helpful. Normative views can motivate us to focus on certain descriptive and causal questions. For example, perhaps you believe that democracy is the most normatively desirable form of government. This might lead you to describe how well democracy works in the U.S. (descriptive) or explain why some countries remain authoritarian (causal). Perhaps you believe that governments should not torture. This might lead you to describe the extent to which certain states use torture (descriptive) or the types of institutional arrangements (independent courts?) that reduce torture (causal).\nReversing the cycle, answers to descriptive and causal questions might inform our normative views. For example, if you know that a majority of the U.S. public supports marriage equality, then you might think the U.S. should allow gays and lesbians to marry. If you know that income equality reduces economic growth, then perhaps you think the U.S. should adopt a more redistributive economic policy.\nNormative questions can motivate descriptive and causal questions. Descriptive and causal questions can inform normative debates. But it is important to draw a sharp distinction between normative questions and descriptive/causal questions, because the two require completely different approaches.\nFor this class, we’ll not focus at all on normative questions. Instead, we’ll focus on descriptive and causal questions."

How has this changed over time?\nWhat percent of eligible voters actually voted in the U.S. in 2010? How does this compare with turnout in other countries?\nHow polarized is the U.S. Congress? How has this changed over time?\n\nAnswering these questions requires some sort of conceptualization (i.e., what do we mean by “polarized”?) and measurement (i.e., how can we quantify “polarization”?). But all that is required is observation. All we need to do make the appropriate measurements (i.e., gather data)."

    "text": "Causal Questions\nCausal questions ask: “Why does the work look the way it does?”\nCausal questions ask about a cause or an effect. They ask for an explanation–why did something happen? We might be interested in the following causal questions:\n\nWhy is income inequality so high in the U.S.? Why is it growing so fast at the moment?\nWhat causes war between two countries?\nWhy do some states become democratic while others remain authoritarian?\nWhat is the effect of an independent court of last resort?\nWhat explains low turnout in the U.S.?\nWhy do some countries have many political parties and other countries have few?\nWhy does policy change rapidly in some times and/or places, but slowly in others?\nDoes presidentialism cause democratic failure?\n\nCausal questions and claims are about action. We have one variable acting on another. There are lots of verbs that summarize action: causes, influences, affects, changes, increases, decreases, etc. Causal questions ask us to use these sorts of verbs to describe the way the world works.\n\nMeaning\nWe use the word “cause” quite a bit in everyday language. We might say, for example, that smoking causes cancer. In making causal claims about politics, we might say things like “wealth causes democracy” or “education causes turnout.”\nBut what do these causal claims really mean? What does it mean for something to cause something else?\nThe idea of causation relies on the counterfactual. The counterfactual requires us to imagine a world that does not exist (i.e., runs counter to fact).\nFor example, suppose Amy has a college degree and voted in 2012. But we want to know if the college degree caused Amy to vote. In order to answer that question, we simply need to consider the counterfactual world in which Amy did not receive a college degree.\nWe might imagine rewinding time and simply removing Amy’s opportunity to attend college (but nothing else), then letting time move forward to 2012 and observing whether Amy votes. If Amy does not vote in the counterfactual world, then we say that the college degree caused Amy to vote. If Amy does vote in the counterfactual world, then we say that the college degree did not cause Amy to vote.\n\nIn order to assess causation, we simply need to imagine what would happen in the counterfactual world where the potential cause did or did not happen. We must compare two scenarios: the world in which the treatment happened to the world in which the treatment did not happen.\n\n\n\nProblem\nIt turns out that these questions are quite difficult to answer. We refer to the problem as “the fundamental problem of causal inference.”\nThe difficulty lies in the fact that we cannot observe the counterfactual world. In our example, we cannot observe whether Amy would have voted if she did not receive a college degree.\n\nBecause we cannot observe the counterfactual, we cannot observe causation. This is general—because causation is defined in terms of something unobservable, we cannot observe causation. This also points to the crucial distinction between descriptive and causal claims. We can observe whether or not descriptive claims are true. We cannot observe whether causal claims are true without a little bit of trickery.\nThere are some tricks to get around this problem, but it changes the question somewhat. For example, if the researcher randomly assigns subjects to a treatment or control group, she can discuss the “average causal effect.” We’ll discuss this in detail later, but be aware that we’ll fight with this problem all semester."
